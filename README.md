# Adversarial-Machine-Leanring-Fim-Review-Classification-Kaggle-Challenge

This code is for an Adversarial Machine Learning Kaggle competition, which challenged participants to classify film reviews as organic or written by an AI. 

All necessary code for this project is in the AdversarialMLCode.R file. The correspondind scores from the Kaggle competition for each of the classification models submitted is also included in this code. This project used several different machine learning algorithms including Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Support Vector Machine (Linear). Since Naïve Bayes performed the best for classification, different text preprocessing was applied in an attempt to optimize the algorithm. 

My contibution for the chllenge is user 'SECU00572021' since the Kaggle competition was anonymous.
